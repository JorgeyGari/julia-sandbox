# Julia Sandbox

Just a sandbox repo where I will upload the files I use to try out [Julia](https://julialang.org).

## Why Julia?

1. Julia is great for scientific computing
2. Julia has excellent packages for symbolic computation
3. Julia has support for nice, math-like notation
4. You can write silly names with emojis for functions (Unicode support)
5. Julia is a dinamically-typed language.
6. Julia supports multiple dispatch (same function may have different definitions depending on the arguments)
7. Reasons 2 and 3 [seem to make Julia a nice fit for developing a CAS](https://www.oscar-system.org/), which is the focus of my Bachelor Thesis
